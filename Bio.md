I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Williams Lab](http://williamslab.ucdavis.edu) at UC Davis. My research focuses on a variety of questions within pollinator ecology.

This website functions as my personal/professional website for hosting summaries of my research, a list of publications, and my CV. You can find more information on my research at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r9e-7i0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page. 


Please get in touch with me if you want to talk bees, genetics, fire, or if you notice any site errors. I am fairly active on twitter if that's your thing: [@_JohnMola](https://twitter.com/_JohnMola).
