I am broadly interested in pollination ecology and pollinator conservation. My dissertation research focuses on (i) determining how, when, and where honey bees compete with native bees for pollen and nectar resources and (ii) assessing the impacts of honey bee introductions on native bee visitation patterns and plant pollination.

# Investigating how honey bee introductions affect native bees and native plants

I'm working in the California Central Valley and the Sierra to ask a series of questions about the impacts of honey bee introductions on (i) the nectar and pollen availability in flowers, (ii) native bee visitation patterns, and (iii) the pollination of native plants.

Native bees and introduced honey bees use many of the same floral resources, which should theoretically lead to competition. However, it is not clear whether honey bee introductions will significantly reduce nectar and pollen availability in all contexts or whether increasing floral abundance in agricultural landscapes may mitigate against competition. 

Even less is known about how honey bee introductions will affect native plant communities. Honey bees could either augment or diminish native plant reproduction, depending on their impact on the visitation patterns and effectiveness of other pollinators as well as their own effectiveness at pollinating native plants.
